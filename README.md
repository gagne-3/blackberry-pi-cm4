> This project is in extremely early phase of development. If you are reading this, I have not done anything concrete with this project, purely some note taking and proofs-of-concepts. I have done my research and I believe my idea is possible, but that is just a theory. If this project doesn't work out, I will mark this repo as an archive just in case. Until then, this repository solely exists as documentation of information relating to adapting a raspberry pi into a Q10 chassis.
